    - Easy : size = 9*9 & mines = 10
    - Medium : size = 16*16 & mines = 40
    - Hard : size = 30*16 & mines = 99

- Developers need to generate a grid depending on the size and the number of mines given by the difficulty.
  (one mine per cell)  MARTIN

- Developers need cells next to mine (that are not mines) to contain the number of adjacent mines. NOAH

- Developers need another grid used to display information of revealed cells to the player. NOAH

- Player can reveal a cell by clicking on it (left-click). If the cell contains a mine, player loses.
  Otherwise, he discovers the numbers of adjacent mines. NOAH

- Developers wants when the player discover a cell without adjacent mines, that all cells surrounding it are also
